            "reviewBody": "Pushpa: The Rise (An Allu Arjun Mass Film) My Review (M. Siraj)\n\nOne of the most awaited Telugu Film which has been creating waver ever since the first look release long time back, today &quot;Pushpa: The Rise&quot; hit the screen amidst high anticipation and rage. Evident from the content Allu Arjun has put his blood and sweat for the film, the crowd goes berserk with his introduction scene.\n\nDirector Sukumar selected a beautiful backdrop, which was not explored much on Telugu screen before, who penned the story of a protagonist smuggling red sandal wood. At three-hour-long, &quot;Pushpa&quot; manages to stay engaging for the most part and never makes sitting through the film tiring. Even though there are some loose ends in the plot, the way Director portrays it as solid story package nullify it. Pushpa aspires to be unique as it a template gangster story of Allu Arjun from a simple coolie who smuggles sandalwood for a Villain Character, to becoming someone as powerful as them, and finally ending up as the biggest force to reckon in his town, that amped up by the music and performance which help from the predicted story.\n\nThe camerawork and editing are on par and cinematography is perfect groove to make the film technically strong and its production values stand out. Camerawork is excellent by capturing the forest sequences so well moreover Peter Hain&apos;s action sequences are hair raising. The VFX effect is perfectly matching with every scene, one cannot differentiate the VFX and original especially in the water falls sequence where Allu Arjun is saving the red sandal wood from Police.\n\nThe film is largely engaging and set against the backdrop of red sandalwood smuggling, a terrific Allu Arjun not just shines in the role with exceptional performance as Pushpa Raj, his transformation of the physique is perfect and makes it one of the most memorable characters in recent years. As far as Allu Arjun is concerned, he came out from his normal chocolate Romeo image and shines in playing this rustic character that is hard on the surface but vulnerable in ways that others don&apos;t see, he truly gleams when he&apos;s in a tussle for power. Whenever he gets a chance to show off his acting chops, he perfectly utilised it, when he shoulders a film as massive as this one, and he ends 2021 with one of the most entertaining movies of the year. The pre-interval sequence of his smartness in the smuggling business is one of the main highlights. He imitates the mannerism of great actor Mohan Lal, slightly downing one shoulder definitely attract his Kerala Fans.\n\nFahd Fazil one of the best actors in Kerala, makes a late entry, played as the Police office is setting up a fierce clash in the second half even though he appears only twenty minutes before the end of the film, the final confrontation didn&apos;t give the desired effect, but he makes his presence felt. His humiliating Allu Arjun is simply superb, One cannot understand why a seasoned actress Samantha comes for a number song, but the Fans go bizarre as she sputters on screen. There are plenty of Characters throughout the film but none leave any impression. Even though there are multiple but powerless antagonists here and there in the film, other than Fahd Fazil, nobody could deliver a stunning or worth performance, shoulder to shoulder with the Hero, the entire film looks like concocting the ground for the second part.",
